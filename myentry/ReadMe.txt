Simple program utilizing the hexbot from the Github noops-challenge for refresher of basic API calls, animation, and manipulation of hexadecimal color codes with plain JavaScript.

Creates animation of expanding circles, starting with purple, then adding continual slight variation to colors via calls to hexbot API. By using color seeding endpoint, manipulation to colors was made possible to limit the variation, adding random but only gradual color changes.
